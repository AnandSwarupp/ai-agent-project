🧠 AI Agent with Human-Like Interaction, Memory & SQL Data Extraction
This project features an AI-powered agent that accepts natural human-like
queries, remembers previous conversations, and fetches relevant information 
from a SQL Server database. It's built using FastAPI, connected to Github
Models GPT-4o model via API, with a modern and responsive frontend built 
using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

🚀 Features
🤖 Conversational AI: Understands and responds to natural language queries.

🧠 Memory: Remembers the context of previous conversations for more natural, continuous interaction.

🔍 Intelligent Data Extraction: Converts user queries into SQL commands to extract relevant data.

⚡ FastAPI Backend: Efficient and fast backend to handle requests and connect to the database.

🌐 Clean Frontend UI: Built with HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap for a responsive experience.

📁 Includes datasets and visual previews of the final AI agent.

🧩 Memory Feature
The AI agent is capable of retaining conversation history during a session. This allows users to
have ongoing discussions without repeating themselves, making the interaction feel more natural 
and human-like.

Create a .env file in your root directory with the following:

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
